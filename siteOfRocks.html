        Rocks
    </h1>

    <h3>
        Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks,sedimentary rocks and
        metamorphic rocks.

    </h3>

    <p>
        In geology, <b>rock</b> (or stone) is any <b>naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals
            or mineraloid matter</b>. It is categorized by the minerals
        included, its chemical composition, and the way in which it is formed.
        Rocks form the Earth's outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior,
        except for the liquid outer core and pockets of <b>magma</b> in the asthenosphere.
        The study of rocks involves multiple subdisciplines of geology, including petrology and mineralogy.
        It may be limited to rocks found on Earth, or it may include planetary geology that studies
        the rocks of other celestial objects.

    <h2>
        Classification
    </h2>

    <h3>Igneous rock</h3>

    <p>
        Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word igneus, meaning of fire, from ignis meaning fire)<sup>[9]</sup>
        is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This magma may be derived from
        partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust.
        Typically, the melting of rocks is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature,
        a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition.
        Igneous rocks are divided into two main categories:
        Plutonic or intrusive rocks result when magma cools and crystallizes
        slowly within the Earth's crust. A common example of this type is granite.
        Volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or
        fragmental ejecta, forming minerals such as pumice or basalt.<sup>[5]</sup>

    <h3>Sedimentary rock</h3>

    <p>
        Sedimentary rocks are formed at the earth's surface by the accumulation and cementation of fragments of earlier
        rocks,
        minerals, and organisms[14] or as chemical precipitates and organic growths in water (sedimentation).
        This process causes clastic sediments (pieces of rock) or organic particles (detritus) to settle
        and accumulate or for minerals to chemically precipitate (evaporite) from a solution.
        The particulate matter then undergoes compaction and cementation at moderate temperatures
        and pressures (diagenesis)

    <h3>Metamorphic rock</h3>

        alt="Image of a Metamorphic Rock">

    <p>
        Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock type—sedimentary rock, igneous rock or
        another older metamorphic rock—to different temperature and pressure conditions than those in
        which the original rock was formed. This process is called metamorphism, meaning to "change in form".
        The result is a profound change in physical properties and chemistry of the stone. The original rock,
        known as the protolith, transforms into other mineral types or other forms of the same minerals,
        by recrystallization.[5] The temperatures and pressures required for this process are always higher
        than those found at the Earth's surface: temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C and pressures greater t
        han 1500 bars.<sup>[18]</sup> This occurs, for example, when continental plates collide.
        Metamorphic rocks compose 27.4% of the crust by volume.
